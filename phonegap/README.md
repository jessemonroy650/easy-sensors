Demonstration programs for IoT and Mobile devices

This system uses *Phonegap Build* to create a mobile application that read data points from an IoT device. The IoT device is either the *Arduino Yun* or the *Particle.io Photon* (formerly the *Spark.io Core*). Data is transfered over the network via *http:* or *ws:*.
